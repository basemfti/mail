CS50 Web Project 3 - CS50 Mail
This is my solution for the CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course, Project 3 - CS50 Mail. The project is a web-based email application that allows users to send, receive, archive, and manage their emails.

Features
Inbox: View incoming emails with a clear distinction between read and unread messages.
Compose: Write and send new emails to other users.
Sent: View emails that have been sent to others.
Archived: Archive emails for later reference.
Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Login & Logout: Users can log in using their credentials, and log out when finished.
Technologies Used
Python: Backend developed using Python (Flask).
HTML/CSS: Frontend built with HTML and CSS.
JavaScript: Added interactivity with JavaScript for dynamic updates.
SQLite: Database for storing user data and emails.
Bootstrap: Used for styling the app and ensuring it is responsive.
Flask: Python web framework used to manage routes and the backend logic.
